# A Survey on High Performance Computing and its Forms

This repository contains a survey paper submitted for the **CECS 530: Advanced Computer Architecture** course at **California State University, Long Beach (CSULB)**.

## Abstract

This paper explores the evolution and current landscape of High-Performance Computing (HPC), focusing on four major paradigms: supercomputing, cluster computing, grid computing, and cloud computing. It analyzes their architectural frameworks, performance evaluation methods, security considerations, and real-world applications. The paper also discusses the integration of machine learning for anomaly detection in HPC systems, and examines emerging trends such as quantum computing and energy-efficient HPC. Through comparative insights, it highlights the strengths, limitations, and future potential of each computing form.
